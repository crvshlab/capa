# capa
> Record animated GIFs (and videos) from the iOS Simulator and Android Emulator. Because a GIF is worth a thousand lines of code.

![](readme_example.gif)

## Motivation
When developing a mobile app within a team that contributes to the code base doing Pull Requests, ~~sometimes~~ it's hard to visualize how the changes will look like in a running App just by looking at the diff. You can help your colleagues by adding an animated GIF into the Pull Request description and this tool wants to make it very simple for you.

## Getting started
1. Install _[gifify](https://github.com/vvo/gifify)_
```shell
$ brew install node
$ brew install ffmpeg --with-libass --with-fontconfig
$ brew install imagemagick --with-fontconfig
$ brew install giflossy
$ npm install -g gifify
```

2. Install _capa_
```shell
$ gem install capa
```

## Usage
### iOS Simulator
```shell
$ capa-ios video.mp4
```

### Android Emulator
```shell
$ capa-android video.mp4
```

Limitations of the [screenrecord utility](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#screenrecord), the Android Emulator recording tool:

* Audio is not recorded with the video file.
* Video recording is not available for devices running Wear OS.
* Some devices might not be able to record at their native display resolution. If you encounter problems with screen recording, try using a lower screen resolution.
* Rotation of the screen during recording is not supported. If the screen does rotate during recording, some of the screen is cut off in the recording.

## Acknowledgments
This tool is a wrapper around `xcrun simctl`, `adb` and [gifify](https://github.com/vvo/gifify)
